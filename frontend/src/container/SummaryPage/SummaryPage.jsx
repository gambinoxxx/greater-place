              <p>
                Hi everyone, my name is Brandy Onwuzuruike and God has given me this vision of Greater Place Nonprofit Inc. David danced with all his might because of God's presence according to 2 Samuel 6:14. I've learned that everyone has their own unique style of dance, but it's the presence of God that truly makes a difference in both our lives and the lives of those who witness our dance.
              </p>
              <p>
                I want to pour out everything within me from a place of deep intimacy with God. I don't want to put on a performance‚ÄîI carry the tangible presence of God. I desire for it to flow naturally within me through the art of dance, whether in worship to God or as a message for those He has called me to reach. It's a continual, consistent posture of surrender before God; it's a lifestyle, not just a one-time performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Creating a space where people of all ages can embrace their God-given creative gifts with confidence and boldness in His presence. For as long as I can remember, dancing as a little girl in God's presence shaped my heart in such a powerful way, and He has pruned me in ways I could never have expected. I truly believe this space will not only bless others but also allow them to experience something similar‚Äîto connect with God through their creative art of dance.

    I've always considered myself a Christian, but for a long time, I didn't really understand what that truly meant. I thought it was just about being a nice person. But it wasn't until I went through some tough times that I started to really understand the power and love of God.
    
    Just over a year ago, when I was 13, I got involved with someone who constantly left me for girls he thought were prettier. It really hurt me and made me hate the way I looked. I just wanted to feel beautiful in his eyes. I felt so low and helpless, and that's when I turned to God.
    
    Around that same time, my friend invited me to her church because she was dancing there. I watched girls my age perform, and for the first time in a long time, I felt peace. I even teared up and didn't know why. Afterward, my friend told me about Brandy, a woman with a small dance group, and encouraged me to join. That's how I became a part of Greater Place.
    
    Even though I joined, I still struggled with low self-esteem. But everything changed when we started dancing to "Something Has to Break." On performance day, Brandy told us to break off anything weighing us down as we danced. I thought about all my pain, and as I danced, I felt lighterâ€”like God had lifted that weight off me. I truly felt His presence, and it was amazing.
    
    Since then, God has continued to work in my life. The move from middle school to high school has been tough, but through FCA and learning to be at peace even when I'm alone, God has kept me going. One big thing I've learned? It's okay to be by yourselfâ€”Jesus walks with me every step I take. I've even noticed that whenever danger like fights happen at school, I always seem to take a different routeâ€”what I once thought was coincidence, I now know is God's protection.
    
    And guess what? I made the cheer team too! I prayed hard for that, and God came through. Now, I understand church messages and praise dance on a whole new level. Everything makes sense because of Him.
    
    At the end of the day, the only one I want to impress or look beautiful for is God. Thank you for listening to my testimony. Rememberâ€”live for God, and you'll find peace. It's so worth it.
    
    God bless you all! ðŸ’›`,
